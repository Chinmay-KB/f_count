# fCount

A Dart equivalent for `console.count()` in JavaScript. You can learn how it works on the web in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/count)

## But why

Using `console.count()` is a very handy way to check for unwanted renders in web projects. This is very useful for any kind of reactive framework.

## How to use it
Place `fCount(*label_name*)` inside any build function and check the logs. Every time the function is called, log prints the total no of times it has been executed.
